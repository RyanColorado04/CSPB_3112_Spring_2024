    <h1>Week 6 Update</h1>
    
    <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
    <p>This past week I set up the Django admin interface for content management and created basic views and URL mappings for site navigation. Everything worked correctly and I can now navigate the site easily.</p>
    
    <p>I also spent a lot of time reading and watching lectures on url routing in Django. I also spent a lot of time learning about url patterns in Django and refreshed my regex knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>I have finished reading the Django book I bought already and am almost done with the YouTube lecture series.</p>
    
    <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
    <p>This week's goal is: Implement user authentication and develop advanced views to enhance site functionality and user interaction.</p>
    <p>I am also going to get my website hosted this week so people in the class can see my progress. I also plan on working on the CSS and making the site better looking.</p>
    
    <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
    <p>There are no impediments in my way. Everything is going smoothly and I feel good about my progress.</p>
    
    <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week. How can you make the process work better?</h2>
    <p>I am actually going to start increasing my goals for the week. I set them too low and will update it in my next post what my goals for each week are. I think I am on track if everything keeps going well to have this website completed by the end of the semester and will be a good part of my portfolio since I am also graduating this semester and will be looking for jobs.</p>
