        <h1>Week 9 Update - Young</h1>
        
        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>This last week I started to play around with hosting on AWS. I deployed a Django web app on Amazon EC2 instance. I followed this YouTube video here:</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiPSnrE6uWE&ab_channel=CloudWithDjango">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiPSnrE6uWE&ab_channel=CloudWithDjango</a>
        <p>I was able to get one of the simple blog apps I made following tutorials in the book I'm reading, but I didn't deploy my project yet. That will be next week.</p>
        <p>The issue I had and why that is not what I deployed is with Django's Custom User Model. It is giving me issues with the SQL tables I converted from this project:</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3287-Project/blob/main/ProjectFor3287.ipynb">https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3287-Project/blob/main/ProjectFor3287.ipynb</a>
        <p>The registered users are unable to interact with the other tables correctly and it is giving me weird errors. Once I get that fixed, I will be back on track to finish my project and reach all of my goals.</p>

        <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
        <p>I am going to finish with AWS tomorrow by watching these 2 videos:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deploy a Django web app with Nginx to Amazon EC2:

            </li>
            <li>Implement Amazon S3 Storage for Static and Media files in Django:

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once I finish these tomorrow, the blog app will be up and people in the class will be able to interact with it. This will be done by noon tomorrow. This weekend I will then figure out my SQL issue. Then, I will deploy the basic outline of the site by next Thursday and that is what I will work on the rest of the semester.</p>

        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>None. These last two weeks I was very busy with my other two classes, but I have no excuse this week. This week I plan on essentially finishing my goals for the whole semester and getting far ahead.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week. How can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>I have fallen behind these past two weeks. This weekend I need to get caught up. I have all my goals set out, so it's just a matter of sitting down and accomplishing them this week. I also need to review SQL tables and triggers to see why my Django tables (which are class objects) aren't working correctly. They worked correctly in pure SQL, so I know the issue is either on the Django side or I made a mistake somewhere converting them. So this week I definitely need to add a review of SQL to make the process work better.</p>
