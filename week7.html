        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>This week I practiced implementing user authentication and develop advanced views to enhance site functionality and user interaction. This was me implementing most of 
            what is in chapter 8 and 9 of the book I am reading and making it more useful to what my eventual project will be.</p>
        <p>Django has a built-in user account, but it is not very useful if you are going to make a more advanced website. Instead, it is recommended that you use the Customer 
            User Model. It is a class that you can add to if you need to increase your functionality. I also worked on some forms to work with the new custom user object.</p>
        <p>Then, I added user authentication. I didn't do very much with it. All that it really does is you can log in and it will print out your “custom” home page, which is 
            basically just the information you entered during the basic sign-up form. However, I now feel knowledgeable about user authentication and account creation in Django. 
            I also have a database, so even though it is incredibly basic, it has the bare minimum of the dynamic websites' functionality.</p>
        <p>I also practiced using some testing in Python and Django. Overall, it was a pretty productive week, and I learned a lot.</p>

    <section id="this-week">
        <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
        <p>This week the goal is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve the site's front-end with CSS frameworks for styling and JavaScript for dynamic content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am going to spend a bunch of time refreshing my knowledge on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I am also going to go over Bootstrap since that is what I am going to use when I make 
            my final page.</p>
        <p>I am also going to look at hosting a website on AWS. I have already used Heroku before, and I would like to learn about AWS more. I might even look at Azure. I'll do a bunch 
            of research this week and write up next week why I chose where to host.</p>

    <section id="impediments">
        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>This is going to be a busy week for me. I have a lot of homework and a midterm in both of my other classes. I don't think I will have a lot of free time, so I won't be able 
            to do any more than I set out to.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week. How can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>I like my current process where I read a chapter in the book or watch something on a video and create their application. Then I take notes and make something similar 
            but different where I must apply that lesson myself.</p>
        <p>I am going to look for a tool that developers use to keep track of the different moving parts and post it on my website as well. I want to make my development 
            process more professional. That is an improvement I am going to make this week.</p>
