    <h1>Week 14 Update - Young</h1>
    <section>
        <p>This week, I went over this article <a href="https://rayobyte.com/blog/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-web-development/">Data Structures and Algorithms in Web Development</a> and solved some of these on Leetcode. Since Django is in Python, I wanted to go over some of the questions I would see in an interview.</p>
        <p>Next week I will submit the final project report.</p>
        <p>There are no obstacles or points of improvement I can think of for this week.</p>
