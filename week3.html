    <h1>Week 3 Update - Young</h1>
    <p>This week I finished my project proposal and I will upload it tonight once I get off work. I will need to go over it again and check for any errors. My goal is to turn my project from SQL into an actual website using Django that is usable and publicly facing. I am going to use Heroku for hosting. For reference, this is my SQL project: <a href="https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3287-Project">CSPB-3287-Project</a>.</p>

    <p>I also started watching Corey Schafer's YouTube videos on Django: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p">Django Tutorial for Beginners</a>. I have made it through the first 5 videos and I got a small website working on my local machine.</p>

    <p>I also bought this book and read the first 2 chapters: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-Build-Websites-Python/dp/1735467200">Django for Beginners</a>. One thing that I have noticed is the YouTube course uses Django class-based views, while the YouTube series uses function-based views. I am going to try mixing it up when I create the website because I have read online that it is important to know both. Sometimes one is better than the other for certain kinds of problems, so I will try to incorporate both to make myself a better programmer.</p>

    <p>I have also started looking over how to do SQL queries in Django. The documentation for that can be found here: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/">Django QuerySet API reference</a>.</p>

    <p>My plan for this week is to set up my Django project environment, including the initial configurations and a Git repository for version control. I will also try to design and implement my database schema using Django models and perform the initial migrations.</p>

    <p>There are no impediments in my way and I see myself accomplishing both of these by next Thursday.</p>

    <p>This week to be better, I need to start the actual coding instead of reading documentation and making plans. I want to have a lot of updates on my GitHub by next week instead of just a README.</p>

    <p>Here is the GitHub I have created for this project: <a href="https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3112_Spring_2024">CSPB-3112_Spring_2024</a>.</p>
