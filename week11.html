            <h2>What did I do last week?</h2>
            <p>This week I worked on debugging my code. I was finally able to get my Custom User Model to work with my SQL tables. I now have the functionality where users can register and buy a product. I used my admin account to add the "products". My SQL is pretty much done for what I wanted to create from the beginning. Now I just need to host it, which I will do this weekend and everyone should be able to register for an account and "buy" a product.</p>

        <section id="this-week">
            <h2>What do I plan to do this week?</h2>
            <p>I will host the website on AWS. I have watched some YouTube videos and found documentation on how to do this, so it shouldn't be too difficult.</p>

        <section id="impediments">
            <h2>Are there any impediments in my way?</h2>
            <p>None. I am making good progress now and it should be completed soon.</p>

        <section id="reflection">
            <h2>Reflection on the process I used last week</h2>
            <p>These past few weeks have just shown me how hard it is to build something from scratch. Unlike in our courses where you have to do all the planning yourself. I wish I had done a better job outlining what I wanted instead of working on it in a less planned out way. I need to start doing something like Agile even if it is just for myself so I keep track of what I am trying to do and what I need to do next for the project to be completed.</p>
