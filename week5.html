    <h1>Weekl 5 Update</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>
        This week I was very busy with my operating systems course so I didn't get much done. However, I did meet my goal this week which luckily was pretty easy which was to design and implement my database schema using Django models and perform the initial migrations. Django uses an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for interacting with SQL databases. An example can be seen <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was able to get my tables from my project set up. I used Chat GPT to help with the first one and the rest were pretty easy to create. I had to do a little refresher on SQL from last semester.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>
        This week's goal is: Set up the Django admin interface for content management and create basic views and URL mappings for site navigation. I also am going to watch some more YouTube videos from Corey Schafer on this topic as well because they are really helpful.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>
        No. I have a 3 day weekend and I'll be done with my OS project and midterm.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process you used last week. How can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Overall, I think it went pretty well. Despite being busy I kept up on my schedule. I got lucky this is an easy week. Next week will be much more time consuming and the weeks are going to get progressively more difficult. Having a 3 day weekend will help me get caught up.
