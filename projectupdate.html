        <h1>Project Update - Young</h1>
        <p>I have learned a lot but at the same time don’t think I have done anything to be proud of quite yet. I feel pretty good about what I’ve learned so far though. I have watched almost 20 hours on Django lectures and read a whole book on it, which was 16 chapters and four projects. I feel like I know it well, and now it is just time to start building. The Schafer videos are excellent and have taught me how to create Django websites from scratch.</p>

        <p>I have a few accomplishments so far, but I have not reached all of my goals yet. I have learned so much about Django and how it works by learning from multiple sources. I have built a SQL database with migrations, and I have learned how to integrate that to Django. I have also gotten more advanced on user interaction such as users being able to register an account with custom user objects. I have also done a lot of studying of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>That being said, I have not done as good as I could have. I should have a better website at this point. At this point in the semester, I expected to have an interactive website, but I plan on having that done this week. I will host it on AWS because I want to learn more about that as well, so I will start learning about that this week.</p>

        <p>Overall, I feel like I have learned a lot, but I haven't done as much coding as I should. That is all going to change now as I focus my efforts 100% into coding, debugging, and deploying the website. I'm excited to see where the rest of the semester takes me.</p>
