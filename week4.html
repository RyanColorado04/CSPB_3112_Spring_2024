    <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
    <p>
        I got my GitHub pages working so I can put my progress on a website to get full credit.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also finished the Django For Beginners Book by William S. Vincent this week. There were only 15 chapters and it is a pretty quick read. I have done code through the first 4 chapters and I will push that up to GitHub tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
        I reached the goal I set out for myself for this week which was to setup my Django project environment, including initial configurations and a Git repository for version control.
    </p>

    <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
    <p>
        This week the goal is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design and implement my database schema using Django models and perform the initial migrations.</li>
        <li>I'm also going to start looking at hosting. I was originally thinking Heroku, but I might go with AWS to get some experience with that for my resume.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
    <p>
        I have a lot of HW and studying this weekend. I have a midterm next week and a project due for my operating systems class. I also have my security course HW as well. It is going to be very busy.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h2>
    <p>
        I did a lot of reading and watched a lot of videos this week because I had some downtime at work when we were doing migrations. I didn't do nearly as much coding as I would have liked. However, it may be helpful as I move through the coding in these chapters to have already read them. So far the coding hasn't been too bad, but I've mostly just been setting up my environment and GitHub. The coding has been pretty basic.
