    <h1>Week 13 Update - Young</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>I apologize for making excuses this week, but I moved on Friday and Saturday and I was sick all week and missed work all week. The only time I worked on anything was to turn in some absolutely necessary homework. However, I did try to do something this week by looking at setting up automated emails for my website. I looked at SendGrid, which was recommended in my Django book. SendGrid is a cloud-based email service that provides reliable email delivery, scalability, and real-time analytics. Integrating it with Django allows you to manage email sending capabilities efficiently, such as sending notifications, promotional emails, or transactional messages. They have a free version and a trial one. I also went onto Leetcode and looked at algorithms most commonly used in web design. Hashing and sorting were listed the most, so I reviewed some algorithms in Python that would be normally used.</p>

        <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
        <p>Next week, I am going to finish my project and everything will be done. I didn't get much done this week due to being sick.</p>

        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>I do not see any major impediments going forward, and I think everything will be done next week and I will post the final website here. I will still continue to improve it the last few weeks. I said this last week, but being sick made me get behind.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>To improve my process for next week, I am going to write out in pseudocode everything I want to add in the future and use an Agile system for the rest of the semester.</p>
