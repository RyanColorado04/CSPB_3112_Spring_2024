    <h1>Week 10 Update - Young</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>This week I worked on debugging my code. I am still unable to get my Custom User Model to work with my SQL tables. I spent about 5 hours trying to get it to work and was still unable to. I followed these steps here: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging</a> and have watched a bunch of videos on debugging in Python, so that was actually really helpful and will help me in the long term.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to waste a week, so I also watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O1H9kr1CsA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O1H9kr1CsA</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVQcNN0cXE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVQcNN0cXE</a> which are helpful for hosting a website on AWS. I was able to get my basic web app from the book deployed on AWS and reachable.</p>

        <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
        <p>Get my actual code debugged and host it on AWS. I will also follow these steps here: <a href="https://medium.com/@chodvadiyasaurabh/deploying-a-python-django-project-on-aws-step-by-step-guide-with-commands-84ca8a4f9d6f">https://medium.com/@chodvadiyasaurabh/deploying-a-python-django-project-on-aws-step-by-step-guide-with-commands-84ca8a4f9d6f</a> and get an SSL cert and a custom domain name using sing Route 53. We use this at work so I have some experience with it.</p>

        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>None. I just need to keep debugging and looking on Stack Overflow and other places for help on what could be causing the issue.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>This week has just shown me how hard it is to build something from scratch. In these classes, there is always an outline to help and a plan to follow. Doing everything on my own from the design to the deployment is tougher than I imagined, but a great learning experience.</p>
