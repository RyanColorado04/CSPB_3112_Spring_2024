        <h1>Week 8 Update - Young</h1>
        
        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>This week I refreshed myself on CSS and HTML. I went through all of the W3 schools lessons on CSS and HTML. Django abstracts so much of this from the user with forms and templates and things like that that I felt like I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
        <p>Django uses HTML templates. These templates are essentially sophisticated and dynamic HTML files that can incorporate variable names that are substituted with real time data when they are rendered. I have some experience with this in Flask from a few semesters ago. However, so much of what I was doing with the forms from my tutorials led me to have no idea what was really happening, so I went back and had to refresh myself on everything so I actually knew what the code I was "writing" was doing.</p>
        <p>Django also has useful inheritance mechanism that streamline the reuse of HTML structures across various pages. This approach ensures uniformity across a website but also significantly minimizes the redundancy so you don't have to rewrite code. However, I again felt like what I was doing I really didn't understand what was happening on the backend. By going through all the HTML lectures, I have a much better idea of what these forms that are inherited are doing.</p>
        <p>With CSS, Django treats these files as static and are stored in a specific directory within a Django project under an app's static section. Django simplifies the management of these static files by allowing them to be used in all applications. However I again wasn't 100% sure what I was doing here since I was using code from the book and lectures I was going through so I wanted to know what I was actually doing. I went through W3 schools and played around with CSS. I also used this site jsfiddle.net to play around with CSS and how it affects the HTML.</p>
        <p>I feel much better about this now and by next week I will have a site hosted that people on here can register accounts for. Hopefully people here are willing to test.</p>

        <h2>What do you plan to do this week?</h2>
        <p>This week I am going to put everything together. I have finished the book I bought and the majority of the lectures on YouTube. I will host and allow people in this class to register accounts and "buy" a product. I just have a bit more troubleshooting to do.</p>

        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>None. This week I was busy with my other classes but I have no excuse this week. This week I plan on essentially finishing my goals for the whole semester and getting far ahead.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week. How can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>I have watched too many lectures and read too much while not doing enough coding. From now on, I have learned enough and it will all be strictly coding and testing. I have no excuse for not putting out a nice website by next Thursday. It won't be perfect, but it's time to stop strictly learning and start building.</p>
