    <h1>Week 12 Update - Young</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>What did you do last week?</h2>
        <p>This week I played around with React and checked if it is something I can add to my website. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a responsive and dynamic user experience. From my research, the most common approach is to use Django as the backend, providing an API (using the Django REST Framework), and React as the frontend for the user interface. The React application makes HTTP requests to the Django backend to fetch or manipulate data. It is pretty cool and I was able to make some nice interfaces, but I didn't integrate it with my website. This was more just to see how it works since it is very popular with web designers, including some of the stuff my team supports at work. Our onboarding application uses React for example.</p>

        <h2>Are there any impediments in your way?</h2>
        <p>I do not see any major impediments, and I think everything will be done next week and I will post the final website. I will still continue to improve it the last few weeks.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h2>
        <p>To improve my process for next week, I am going to write out in pseudocode everything I want to add in the future and use an Agile system for the rest of the semester.</p>
