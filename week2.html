    <h1>Week 2: I apologize for this being late</h1>
    <p>I saw Dylan's proposal and realized that I never submitted this. I had it done on Friday, but it was still in my drafts. It won't happen again.</p>
    <p>I have decided that I'm going to go with Django and make my SQL project from last semester a reality. I bought 3 books on Django and found a YouTube series on how to create a Django project. I already created a basic website that can accomplish this. The problem I have will be converting this to Django's Python based SQL mapping and making it work. I think I can get most of this done by the ends of the semester.</p>
